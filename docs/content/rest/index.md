# REST API quickstart

The EVEData REST API will provide unified, developer-friendly access to EVE Online data through modern, performant endpoints. The initial release will focus on market data with simple authentication via bearer tokens, intuitive query patterns, and response times that rival or exceed existing services. As outlined in the [project vision](../vision.md), EVEData's goal is to provide APIs that work on the first try without complicated OAuth flows or confusing documentation. Check the [roadmap][evedata-roadmap] to track progress toward the first API release.
