# Webhooks quickstart

Event-driven notifications will allow your applications to receive updates when specific conditions are met, like price thresholds or new market orders in watched systems. The webhook system will include a management portal for creating and monitoring subscriptions, with delivery guarantees and retry logic built in. The [project vision](../vision.md) outlines how webhooks fit into EVEData's real-time capabilities. Track webhook development progress on the [roadmap][evedata-roadmap].
