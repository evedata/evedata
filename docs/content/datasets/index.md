# Datasets quickstart

Direct access to raw and curated datasets will be available for bulk analysis and machine learning applications. From complete market snapshots to historical killmail aggregates, these datasets will be provided in efficient formats like Parquet with clear documentation on structure and update frequency. As noted in the [project vision](../vision.md), community access to both raw and processed data is a core platform feature. Watch the [roadmap][evedata-roadmap] for dataset availability progress.
