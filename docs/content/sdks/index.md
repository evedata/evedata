# SDKs

Official client libraries will make integrating with EVEData effortless across popular languages and frameworks. Starting with Python and TypeScript/JavaScript, the SDKs will provide type-safe access to all API endpoints, automatic retry logic for transient failures, and intuitive abstractions for common EVE data patterns. As outlined in the [project vision](../vision.md), developer experience is EVEData's top priority. These libraries will handle the complexity so you can focus on building great tools for New Eden. See the [roadmap][evedata-roadmap] to track SDK development for your preferred language.
