# Hello, New Eden

EVEData is a new data platform for EVE Online, built to make game data accessible and delightful to work with. As a solo passion project that's just getting started, I'm working to create developer-first APIs that eliminate the complexity of working with ESI and the SDE, offering unified access to market data, killmails, industry information, and more through modern, performant endpoints built on top of a robust ESI ingestion architecture and data lake.

Development logs and project updates will appear here as EVEData takes shape. I'll share technical deep-dives, infrastructure decisions, lessons learned, and progress reports as I build out the platform. These posts will offer transparency into the development process, celebrate milestones (and document setbacks), and occasionally explore interesting patterns in EVE's data ecosystem. While I'm still laying the foundation, expect the first real posts soon as I tackle the initial challenges of building a modern data platform for New Eden.

To learn more about where EVEData is headed, check out the [project vision](../../vision.md) for the full scope of what I'm building, or follow along with active development on the [roadmap][evedata-roadmap].
