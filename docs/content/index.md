# Welcome to EVEData

EVEData is an emerging data platform for EVE Online that aims to make game data accessible, reliable, and delightful to work with. It's being built with developer-first APIs and data products that eliminate the complexity of working with ESI and the SDE, offering unified access to market data, killmails, industry information, and more through modern, performant endpoints on top of a robust ESI ingestion architecture and data lake.

The platform is in its earliest stages, with it's initial focus on creating a solid foundation for market data before expanding to other core services. While it's just getting started, EVEData's commitment is clear: **to provide the fastest, most reliable data platform for New Eden with transparent development, sustainable infrastructure, and deep respect for the EVE community.**
