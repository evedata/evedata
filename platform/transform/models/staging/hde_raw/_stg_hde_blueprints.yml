    description: "Core blueprint definitions table containing activity times and production limits for all blueprints in EVE Online. Blueprints are the foundation of the industrial system, used to manufacture ships, modules, ammunition, and other items. Each blueprint can support multiple activities including manufacturing (producing items), copying (creating blueprint copies), material efficiency research (reducing material requirements), time efficiency research (reducing production time), invention (creating Tech 2 blueprints from Tech 1), and reactions (chemical processes for advanced materials). This is the parent table with related detail tables containing the specific materials, skills, and products for each activity."
