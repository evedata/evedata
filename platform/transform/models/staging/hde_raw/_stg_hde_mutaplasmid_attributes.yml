  - name: stg_hde_mutaplasmid_attributes
    description: "Defines which module attributes can be modified by each mutaplasmid and the probability ranges for those modifications. When a mutaplasmid is applied to a module, each listed attribute will be randomly modified by a multiplier within the min/max range. The high_is_good flag indicates whether players want higher (1) or lower (0) values for optimal performance, though most records leave this NULL as the modification is a multiplier applied regardless of preference."
