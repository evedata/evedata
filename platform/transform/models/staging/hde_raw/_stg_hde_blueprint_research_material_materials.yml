    description: "Materials consumed during Material Efficiency (ME) research for blueprints. ME research improves the material efficiency of blueprint manufacturing, reducing material requirements by up to 10%. This table defines the research materials (typically datacores and R.Db items) required to perform ME research on each blueprint type. Materials listed here are consumed when initiating the research job."
