    description: "Expert Systems are consumable items that provide temporary skill injections to characters in EVE Online. These items grant players access to specific skills at predetermined levels for a limited duration (typically 1-30 days, most commonly 7 days), allowing new players to experiment with different playstyles and ship types without permanently training the skills. Expert Systems are often tied to events or promotions and enable flying specific ships that would otherwise require weeks or months of skill training."
