    description: "Assembly line configurations that define how industry activities are performed at installations. Each assembly line supports a specific activity type (manufacturing, research, copying, etc.) and applies multipliers to base costs, materials, and time. These multipliers represent the efficiency bonuses or penalties of using that particular assembly line. Assembly lines are associated with installation types through a many-to-many relationship."
