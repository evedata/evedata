    description: "Static universe objects representing physical instances of types in EVE Online space. Contains 517,342 items including celestial bodies (93.5%), stations, stargates, and other permanent fixtures. This is NOT player inventory - these are the actual planets, moons, stations, and other objects that exist in the game universe. Items are instances of types: while a type defines what a planet can be, an item is an actual planet at a specific location. Critical distinction: player-owned items exist in the game database, not in the SDE."
