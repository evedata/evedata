    description: "Materials required for performing time efficiency (TE) research on blueprints. TE research reduces manufacturing time up to a maximum of 20% reduction (10 research levels at 2% each). Research materials include datacores and other specialized components that are consumed during the research process. Each blueprint type may require different materials depending on its complexity and tech level."
