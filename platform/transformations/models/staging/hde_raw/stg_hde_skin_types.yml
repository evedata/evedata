    description: "Bridge table defining which ship types can use specific SKINs. This many-to-many relationship table maps each SKIN to the ship types it can be applied to. Since SKINs are designed for specific hull designs, not all SKINs work with all ships - this table enforces those restrictions. For example, a Megathron SKIN can only be applied to Megathron-class battleships. Each record represents one valid SKIN-to-ship combination."
