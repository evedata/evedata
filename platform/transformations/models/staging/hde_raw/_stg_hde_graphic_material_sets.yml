    description: "Material sets defining visual properties for EVE Online graphics rendering. These sets control how ship skins and other visual elements appear in-game by specifying colors (RGBA values for hull, primary, secondary, and window areas), material textures, and Space Object Factory (SOF) rendering parameters. Each material set can be referenced by skin materials to create unique visual appearances for ships and structures."
