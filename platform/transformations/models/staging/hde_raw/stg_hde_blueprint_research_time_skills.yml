    description: "Skill requirements for performing time efficiency (TE) research on blueprints. TE research reduces the time required for manufacturing by 2% per level, up to a maximum of 20% reduction at TE level 10. Higher skill levels reduce the time needed to complete research jobs. The Research skill is universally required, while advanced blueprints require specialized science skills like Quantum Physics or Graviton Physics."
