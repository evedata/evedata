    description: "Skill requirements for performing Material Efficiency (ME) research on blueprints. ME research improves manufacturing efficiency by reducing material consumption up to 10%. Skills listed here determine research time - higher skill levels reduce the time required. The most common skill requirement is Metallurgy, with specialized science skills required for advanced blueprints."
