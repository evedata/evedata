    description: "Input materials required for reaction processes in EVE Online. Reactions are industrial processes that combine moon minerals, gases, and other raw materials to produce advanced composite materials used in Tech 2 and Tech 3 manufacturing. This model captures all materials consumed when running a reaction job in refineries or reaction facilities."
