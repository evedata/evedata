  - name: sde_moons
    description: "Natural satellites orbiting planets within solar systems, serving as important locations for moon mining, station placement, and player structures. Moons are the primary hosts for NPC stations (77% of all stations) and are critical for resource extraction through moon mining operations. There are 342,170 moons across all systems, with detailed physical and orbital properties."
