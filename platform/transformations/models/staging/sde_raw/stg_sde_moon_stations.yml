    description: "NPC-owned space stations located on or orbiting moons within solar systems. These stations represent 77% of all NPC stations and are commonly found in low-security and null-security space. Moon stations often serve as mining outposts, research facilities, and strategic military installations. Each station is owned by an NPC corporation and provides services based on its operation type."
