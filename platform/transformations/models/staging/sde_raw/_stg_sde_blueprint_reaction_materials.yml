    description: "Input material requirements for reaction processes in EVE Online''s moon mining and advanced material production chain. Reactions are specialized industrial processes using 112 unique reaction formulas to convert moon minerals and intermediate products into advanced materials used in Tech 2 and capital ship production. This bridge table defines the raw moon materials, intermediate composites, and fuel blocks consumed during reaction cycles in refineries and reaction-capable structures."
