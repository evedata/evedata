    description: "Permanent jump gates enabling instantaneous travel between solar systems, forming the backbone of the EVE universe transportation network. Stargates create bidirectional connections between systems, with each gate paired to a corresponding gate in the destination system. Approximately 62% of systems have stargate connections (known space), while 38% are isolated wormhole systems accessible only through temporary wormholes."
