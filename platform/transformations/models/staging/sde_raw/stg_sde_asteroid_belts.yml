    description: |
      Rings of asteroids orbiting planets within solar systems, serving as primary
      mining locations for ore and minerals. Asteroid belts are key resource extraction
      sites where players mine valuable ores for manufacturing and trade. Each asteroid
      belt contains various ore types based on system security status and regional
      location.
