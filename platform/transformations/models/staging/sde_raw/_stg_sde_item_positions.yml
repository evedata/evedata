    description: "Three-dimensional spatial coordinates and orientation data for static universe objects. Defines the exact position and rotation of celestial bodies, stations, stargates, and other fixed objects within their solar systems or other containers. Positions are relative to the parent container (usually the solar system center). The coordinate system uses meters as the base unit, with orientation specified using Euler angles for pitch, roll, and yaw rotations."
