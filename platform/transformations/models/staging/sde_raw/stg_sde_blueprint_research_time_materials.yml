    description: "Material requirements for Time Efficiency (TE) research on blueprint originals in EVE Online''s industry optimization system. TE research reduces manufacturing, reaction, and other activity times by up to 20% (TE level 0-10, each level providing 2% reduction). This bridge table defines the research materials (typically datacores and data sheets) consumed during TE research attempts. Like ME research, each TE level becomes progressively more expensive, creating strategic decisions about time versus material optimization."
