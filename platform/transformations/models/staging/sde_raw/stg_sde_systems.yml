    description: "Solar systems representing the primary playable space in EVE Online. Each system contains celestial objects (planets, moons, asteroid belts), stations, and stargates for inter-system travel. Systems are categorized by security status from high-sec (1.0) to null-sec (-1.0), with 38% being wormhole systems without permanent stargate connections. The 8,437 systems form the explorable universe across five universe types."
