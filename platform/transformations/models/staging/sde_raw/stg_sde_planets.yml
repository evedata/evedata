  - name: sde_planets
    description: "Planets orbiting stars within solar systems, representing major celestial bodies that can host moons, stations, and serve as anchors for asteroid belts. Each planet has detailed physical properties including composition, atmosphere, and orbital characteristics. Planets are key locations for planetary interaction (PI) and may host NPC stations. There are 67,961 planets across all systems with coordinates at the 10^10 scale."
