    description: "Material requirements for Material Efficiency (ME) research on blueprint originals in EVE Online''s industry optimization system. ME research reduces the base material requirements for manufacturing, with levels from 0% to 10% reduction. This bridge table defines the research materials (typically datacores and data sheets) consumed during ME research attempts. Each level of ME research becomes progressively more expensive and time-consuming, creating a strategic decision about optimization investment."
