  - name: sde_blueprints
    description: "Core blueprint definitions containing activity times and production limits for EVE Online''s industry system. This table defines the master records for all 5,031 blueprints in the game, including their base time requirements for various industrial activities (manufacturing, copying, invention, research, and reactions). Each blueprint has a sparse ID matching its corresponding item type_id in sde_types, ranging from 681 to 88,734. Related activity-specific materials, products, and skill requirements are stored in separate bridge tables that reference this master table."
