    description: "Mid-level geographical divisions that group solar systems within regions. Constellations serve as navigational waypoints between the vast regions and individual solar systems. There are 1,175 constellations across the EVE universe, forming the intermediate layer in the three-tier spatial hierarchy (regions → constellations → systems)."
