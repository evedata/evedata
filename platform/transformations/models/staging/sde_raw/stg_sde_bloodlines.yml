      Defines the character bloodlines that provide racial sub-divisions within the four
      main empires. Each bloodline determines starting attributes (charisma,
      intelligence, memory, perception, willpower), starting NPC corporation, and
      cultural heritage. Bloodlines are a key part of character creation and provide
      lore-based differentiation within races.
