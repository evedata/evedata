    description: "Comprehensive catalog of all item type definitions in EVE Online, serving as templates for every game object. Contains 50,235 types including ships, modules, ammunition, blueprints, skills, celestial objects, and more. Types are the foundational data layer - they define what things can exist, while items (in sde_items) are the actual instances in space. Only 51.4% of types are published and visible to players. Types with market_group_id NULL cannot be traded on the market. Critical for manufacturing calculations via portion_size field."
