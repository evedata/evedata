    description: "Output products from reaction processes in EVE Online''s advanced material production chain. Reactions using the 112 specialized formulas produce intermediate composites and advanced materials essential for Tech 2, Tech 3, and capital ship manufacturing. This bridge table maps reaction formulas to their outputs, which include complex composites, advanced alloys, and specialized components that cannot be obtained through traditional mining or manufacturing."
